Modern astronomy generates data at an unprecedented scale, from terabytes of survey images to millions of stellar catalogs. Yet researchers often struggle with fragmented tools that can't talk to each other, forcing them to jump between applications to cross-reference a single object across different wavelengths or missions. Firefly solves this fundamental challenge by creating a unified web-based environment where astronomical data comes alive through integrated visualization.

Built on React and powered by Plotly.js, Firefly delivers sophisticated brushing and linking capabilities that connect FITS images, catalog data, and scientific plots in real-time. Point to a star in an infrared image, and instantly see its photometric data, light curves, and spectral energy distribution. The framework handles everything from HiPS all-sky surveys to detailed FITS visualization, with native support for astronomical coordinate systems and proper motion overlays. Its modular architecture means you can embed powerful astronomy visualization into any web application with minimal setup.

Firefly isn't just academic software—it's the production engine behind major NASA archives including IRSA's interfaces for WISE, Spitzer, and the Zwicky Transient Facility, plus the upcoming Vera Rubin Observatory Science Platform. This battle-tested foundation processes millions of queries from the global astronomy community, proving that web-based tools can match desktop applications for serious scientific work. With Docker deployment and comprehensive APIs, Firefly makes enterprise-grade astronomical visualization accessible to any research team ready to modernize their data exploration workflow.
