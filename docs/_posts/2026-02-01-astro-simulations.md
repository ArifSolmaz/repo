Understanding astronomical phenomena often requires visualizing processes that span vast scales of time and space - from the delicate dance of binary star eclipses to the precise mechanics governing planetary habitability zones. Traditional static diagrams fall short when explaining why we see lunar phases or how astronomers detect distant exoplanets through transit photometry.

This collection of eight interactive JavaScript simulations transforms abstract astronomical concepts into hands-on learning experiences. The suite includes a Lunar Phase Simulator that reveals the geometry behind moon phases, an Exoplanet Transit Simulator demonstrating how we detect worlds orbiting distant stars, and a Circumstellar Habitable Zone Simulator exploring the cosmic real estate where liquid water can exist. Each simulation leverages modern web technologies to replace legacy Flash animations, offering real-time parameter adjustment and responsive visualizations that work across devices.

Originally developed from University of Nebraska's renowned astronomy education materials, these tools serve educators worldwide teaching introductory astronomy and planetary science. The modular architecture makes them ideal for integration into learning management systems, while the open-source codebase enables customization for specific research or educational needs. Whether you're explaining small-angle approximation to undergraduate students or demonstrating gas retention mechanisms on different planetary bodies, these simulations bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and intuitive understanding.
