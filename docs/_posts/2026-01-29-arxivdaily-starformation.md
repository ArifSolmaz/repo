In the fast-paced world of astronomical research, staying current with the latest discoveries in star formation and molecular cloud physics can feel like drinking from a fire hose. With hundreds of papers published weekly on ArXiv, researchers risk missing breakthrough studies that could reshape their understanding of how stars are born from the cold, dark depths of interstellar space.

ArXivDaily_StarFormation solves this challenge with elegant automation. Built in Python and powered by GitHub Actions, it scans ArXiv daily at 2:30 AM UTC, intelligently filtering papers using customizable keywords like 'molecular cloud,' 'interstellar medium,' and 'filament' while excluding irrelevant topics. The system automatically updates your repository with fresh papers, complete with abstracts, author information, and direct links. What makes this tool truly stellar is its adaptability—despite its star formation focus, the framework can be personalized for any astronomical field, from exoplanets to gravitational waves.

Whether you're studying the N-PDF of turbulent gas or investigating protostellar core collapse, this automated curator ensures you never miss a critical paper again. Perfect for individual researchers, observatories, or astronomy departments looking to streamline their literature review process, it transforms the overwhelming ArXiv firehose into a focused, manageable stream of relevant discoveries.
