Ever wanted to upscale that grainy old video or boost your anime collection to 4K without spending hours learning complex ML pipelines? Video2X just got a complete C++ rewrite that makes professional-grade video enhancement stupidly simple. This isn't another janky Python wrapper – it's a blazing-fast, cross-platform framework that handles the heavy lifting while you grab coffee.

The 6.0.0 rewrite brings Real-ESRGAN for photorealistic upscaling, RIFE for buttery-smooth frame interpolation, and Anime4K for crisp animation enhancement. All running on Vulkan with zero disk space waste during processing. Whether you're restoring family videos, enhancing gaming footage, or preparing content for modern displays, it supports everything from custom GLSL shaders to the latest ncnn models. The GUI makes it accessible to everyone, while the CLI keeps power users happy.

With 18K+ stars and a thriving community, this project has proven itself in the wild. The hardware requirements are reasonable (any GPU from 2012+), setup is painless with Windows installers, and the results speak for themselves. If you've ever needed video upscaling that actually works without a PhD in computer vision, this is your new best friend.
