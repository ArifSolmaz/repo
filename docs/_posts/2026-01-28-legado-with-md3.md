Most e-book readers force you into their rigid interface and limited format support. Legado with MD3 flips that script entirely - it's a highly customizable reading app that crawls any website to create book sources, supports local files, and now wraps it all in a gorgeous Material Design 3 interface with predictive back gestures and shared element animations.

Beyond the visual upgrade, this fork adds reading analytics with timeline views, improved manga/audiobook interfaces, tablet-optimized layouts, and smart grouping that automatically sorts your read/unread books. The custom crawler engine lets you turn virtually any website into a book source with simple rules, while advanced features like content filtering, font customization, and multiple page-turning modes ensure your reading experience is exactly what you want.

With 1.8k stars and active development migrating to Jetpack Compose, this is perfect for power readers who want control over their digital library. The developer acknowledges it's built on the shoulders of the excellent original Legado project but adds enough unique functionality to stand on its own.
