Every 30 minutes, NASA's TESS satellite captures the brightness of hundreds of thousands of stars, searching for the telltale dimming that signals an exoplanet transit. But transforming these raw photometric observations into scientific discoveries requires sophisticated analysis of complex time series data—a challenge that has traditionally created barriers for students and researchers new to space-based astronomy.

Lightkurve elegantly bridges this gap by providing a comprehensive Python toolkit specifically designed for Kepler and TESS mission data. The package handles everything from downloading target pixel files and light curves from NASA archives to performing advanced detrending, period analysis, and transit fitting. With its intuitive API, you can visualize stellar variability, remove systematic noise, identify periodic signals, and even create custom photometric apertures—all with just a few lines of code. Built on the robust AstroPy ecosystem, it seamlessly integrates with existing astronomical workflows.

This community-driven project has become essential infrastructure for exoplanet science, enabling discoveries by professional astronomers while making cutting-edge analysis techniques accessible to citizen scientists and students. Whether you're characterizing stellar rotation, hunting for new worlds, or developing automated detection pipelines, Lightkurve provides the reliable foundation that has helped unlock thousands of exoplanet discoveries from space telescope archives.
