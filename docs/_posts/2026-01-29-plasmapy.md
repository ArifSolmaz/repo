The universe is 99% plasma - from the scorching corona of our Sun to the exotic environments around black holes, from the solar wind buffeting Earth's magnetosphere to the fusion reactions powering stellar cores. Yet until now, researchers studying this fundamental state of matter have lacked a unified computational framework to tackle plasma physics across astronomical scales.

PlasmaPy fills this critical gap with a comprehensive Python package designed for plasma research and education. Built on the robust Astropy ecosystem, it provides essential tools for calculating plasma parameters, analyzing particle distributions, modeling electromagnetic fields, and simulating wave propagation. Whether you're investigating magnetic reconnection in solar flares, characterizing space weather phenomena, or developing fusion energy solutions, PlasmaPy offers validated algorithms for Debye lengths, gyrofrequencies, transport coefficients, and dispersion relations - all with proper unit handling and physical constants.

This community-driven project serves researchers across heliophysics, astrophysics, and laboratory plasma science, bridging the gap between theoretical plasma physics and practical computational research. With its growing ecosystem of specialized modules and commitment to open science principles, PlasmaPy is becoming the standard toolkit for the next generation of plasma physicists exploring everything from tokamak optimization to the mysteries of cosmic ray acceleration.
