Ever wondered what a sunset looks like on Mars, or how the sky appears during a solar eclipse on an exoplanet orbiting a red dwarf? CalcMySky transforms these cosmic curiosities into pixel-perfect reality through sophisticated light scattering simulation. Based on Bruneton's groundbreaking atmospheric scattering research, this tool models how photons dance through planetary atmospheres, creating the subtle gradients and phenomena we observe - from Earth's blue skies to the ethereal glows of alien worlds.

The software package delivers a complete atmospheric rendering pipeline: the calcmysky utility precomputes complex scattering models, libShowMySky provides real-time rendering capabilities, and ShowMySky offers an interactive preview interface. Beyond standard Earth atmospheres, it excels at exotic scenarios - simulate atmospheric optics phenomena like glories and fogbows, model solar eclipses with multiple scattering orders, or craft entirely fictional planetary environments with custom stellar spectra and atmospheric compositions.

Planetarium software developers, space visualization artists, and atmospheric physics researchers are already leveraging CalcMySky to create immersive astronomical experiences. While currently limited to spherically symmetric atmospheres (no localized cloud systems), its physically-based approach ensures scientifically accurate results that bridge the gap between rigorous atmospheric science and stunning visual applications.
