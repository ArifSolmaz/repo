Ever tried configuring an OpenWrt router through SSH and wished someone would just build a proper web interface? That's exactly what LuCI delivers - it's the official configuration interface that ships with OpenWrt by default, turning complex network configuration into intuitive web forms. No more editing config files by hand or memorizing obscure CLI commands.

What sets LuCI apart is its comprehensive coverage of OpenWrt functionality. From basic network settings and WiFi configuration to advanced firewall rules, VPN setup, and package management - it's all accessible through clean, responsive web pages. The architecture is surprisingly modern too, with a JavaScript frontend talking to ucode-based backend APIs (they're actively migrating away from Lua). Plus, it's internationalized through Weblate with support for dozens of languages.

Whether you're running OpenWrt on a home router or managing enterprise network gear, LuCI is likely already installed and running. But if you're building custom firmware, extending functionality, or just curious about how router web interfaces work under the hood, this repo is your gateway. The codebase is mature, well-documented, and actively maintained by the OpenWrt team.
