When astronomers peer through the cosmos at distant worlds or study the atmospheric layers of planets in our own solar system, they're essentially cosmic detectives decoding light. Every photon carries secrets about temperature, pressure, and chemical composition—but unlocking these mysteries requires sophisticated analysis of how radiation travels through planetary atmospheres. This is where the challenge begins: transforming raw spectroscopic data into meaningful scientific understanding.

ArchNEMESIS rises to meet this challenge as a comprehensive Python toolkit for radiative transfer and atmospheric retrieval. Built upon the proven NEMESIS algorithm that has powered decades of planetary research, this open-source package employs non-linear optimal estimation techniques to extract atmospheric properties from remote sensing observations. Whether you're analyzing methane distributions in Titan's haze, tracking temperature profiles in Jupiter's storms, or characterizing exoplanet atmospheres from transit spectra, ArchNEMESIS provides the computational framework to transform spectral signatures into quantitative atmospheric science.

Maintained by an active community of planetary scientists and backed by extensive documentation, ArchNEMESIS democratizes access to professional-grade atmospheric analysis tools. The package supports a wide variety of planetary environments and observation geometries, making it invaluable for mission scientists working with data from spacecraft like JWST, Cassini, or Mars rovers, as well as researchers modeling atmospheric processes across the solar system and beyond.
