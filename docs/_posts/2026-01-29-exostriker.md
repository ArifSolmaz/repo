In the quest to find and characterize worlds beyond our solar system, astronomers face a complex challenge: extracting the subtle gravitational signatures of planets from noisy observational data. The Exo-Striker rises to meet this challenge, providing researchers with a comprehensive toolkit to analyze the minute wobbles in stellar motion (radial velocities) and the tiny dips in starlight (transits) that reveal the presence of exoplanets orbiting distant stars.

This sophisticated Python package combines the computational efficiency of Fortran with Python's flexibility, offering everything from Generalized Lomb-Scargle periodograms for signal detection to full N-body dynamical modeling of multi-planet systems. Researchers can perform MCMC and nested sampling analyses, model Gaussian processes for stellar activity, extract and analyze transit timing variations (TTVs), and even assess the long-term orbital stability of planetary systems. The tool's interactive capabilities include real-time plotting, automated planet-finding algorithms, and seamless data manipulation for outlier removal and binning.

Developed at the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy, The Exo-Striker has become an essential resource for exoplanet researchers worldwide, enabling discoveries in complex multi-planet systems and advancing our understanding of planetary dynamics. Whether you're analyzing data from ground-based surveys or space missions like TESS and Kepler, this cross-platform tool transforms raw astronomical observations into detailed portraits of alien solar systems.
