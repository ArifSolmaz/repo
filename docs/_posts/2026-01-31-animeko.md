Tired of juggling multiple apps to discover new anime, track your watchlist, and actually watch episodes? Animeko solves the anime fan's fragmentation problem by cramming everything into one polished app. It's like having MyAnimeList, a torrent client, and a video player merged into something that actually works well together.

What sets this apart is the execution: real-time danmaku comments overlay your videos (think Niconico-style), seamless BitTorrent integration for streaming without waiting for full downloads, offline caching for your commute, and two-way sync with Bangumi to keep your progress updated. The UI is pure Jetpack Compose across Android, iOS, Windows, macOS, and Linux - same smooth experience everywhere. Smart cloud filtering keeps spam comments out of your viewing experience.

With 14.8k stars and active development, this hits the sweet spot between feature-rich and actually usable. The 100% Kotlin/Compose codebase means consistent updates across all platforms. Perfect for anime enthusiasts who want their workflow streamlined without sacrificing the community aspects that make anime watching social.
