Every astronomer knows the frustration: you've captured incredible data from the cosmos, but turning those FITS files into meaningful visualizations feels like solving another mystery of the universe. Whether you're analyzing spectral data from distant galaxies or processing radio telescope observations, the journey from raw data to publication-ready plots can be surprisingly complex.

FitsAutoPlot eliminates this bottleneck with Python 3.8-powered automation that seamlessly connects AstroPy's robust FITS handling with Veusz's professional plotting capabilities. The toolkit doesn't just handle astronomical data—it's built for the real world of research, supporting everything from Keysight network analyzer files to Rhode & Schwarz test equipment output. Users can generate sophisticated plots without writing a single line of Python, then fine-tune visualizations directly in Veusz's intuitive interface. The system handles Touchstone files for RF analysis, creates polar plots for antenna patterns, and even generates Smith charts for impedance analysis.

This is particularly valuable for radio astronomy teams, satellite communication researchers, and anyone working at the intersection of astronomy and RF engineering. The automated averaging, extrema detection, and error bar generation save countless hours of manual data processing, letting researchers focus on the science rather than the scripting.
