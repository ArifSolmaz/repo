Tired of Apple deciding which apps you can run on your own iPhone? AltStore is the elegant rebellion iOS developers have been waiting for. Using a clever combination of personal development certificates and iTunes WiFi sync, it bypasses Apple's restrictions entirely - no jailbreaking, no sketchy enterprise certificates, just your regular Apple ID.

The magic happens through a desktop companion (AltServer) that re-signs apps with your personal certificate and pushes them to your device. It even handles the annoying 7-day expiration by auto-refreshing apps in the background. Built primarily to distribute Delta (the beloved all-in-one iOS emulator), it's now expanding to support any developer who wants to distribute outside Apple's walled garden.

While it requires some technical setup, the 13k+ stars speak volumes about developers hungry for alternatives. The codebase is clean Swift with familiar frameworks (Core Data, Auto Layout), making contributions accessible to most iOS developers. If you've ever felt constrained by App Store policies, this is your escape hatch.
