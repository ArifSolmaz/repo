Ever tried tracking down suspicious profiles across dozens of social platforms manually? Social Analyzer eliminates that tedious detective work by automatically scanning 1000+ social media sites for usernames, complete with intelligent scoring from 0-100 based on detection confidence. Unlike basic username checkers that flood you with false positives, this tool uses multiple detection layers including OCR, metadata analysis, and advanced pattern matching to separate real profiles from noise.

The toolkit is surprisingly comprehensive: web app for visual investigations, CLI for automation, profile screenshots, metadata extraction with force-directed graphs, and even age estimation capabilities. It can handle name permutations, multi-profile correlation searches, and integrates Google/DuckDuckGo APIs for enhanced reconnaissance. The fact that law enforcement agencies with limited resources actually deploy this in production speaks volumes about its reliability.

Whether you're investigating cyberbullying, researching threat actors, or conducting due diligence, this beats manually checking platforms one by one. The 20K+ stars and active development suggest a mature tool that's found its niche in the OSINT community.
