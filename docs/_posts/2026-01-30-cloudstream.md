Tired of juggling 12 different streaming apps, each with their own ads, tracking, and limitations? CloudStream takes a radically different approach: it's a blank canvas that becomes whatever media center you need through extensions. Want YouTube videos? There's an extension. Twitch streams? Extension. Librivox audiobooks? Extension. Even IPTV channels from around the world.

With 8,732 stars, this Kotlin-built app has struck a chord with developers who appreciate its clean architecture and zero-BS approach. No ads, no tracking, no artificial restrictions - just a solid foundation with phone/TV support, Chromecast integration, and bookmarks. The extension system means you're not locked into anyone's content strategy or business model. It's refreshingly honest about what it is: a tool that becomes useful only when you add the extensions you actually want.

Perfect for developers who want control over their media consumption or anyone building custom streaming solutions. The community is active (they even have templates for bug reports), and the 'good-first-issue' tag suggests newcomers are welcome. Fair warning though: you'll need to install extensions to do anything - but that's exactly the point.
