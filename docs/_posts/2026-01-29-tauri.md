Tired of 200MB+ Electron apps that eat your RAM for breakfast? Tauri lets you build native desktop and mobile apps using your favorite web frontend (React, Vue, Svelte, whatever) while keeping bundle sizes under 10MB. Instead of shipping an entire Chromium browser, it uses the system's native webview (WKWebView, WebView2, WebKitGTK) with a Rust-powered backend.

What sets Tauri apart is the architecture: your frontend talks to a secure Rust API layer that handles system operations, file access, and native features like system tray icons, notifications, and auto-updates. You get built-in bundlers for every platform (.app, .deb, .msi, .exe), a plugin ecosystem, and the memory safety of Rust without sacrificing the rapid development of web technologies. Apps start faster, use less memory, and feel genuinely native.

With 100K+ stars and production apps already shipping, Tauri has proven itself as the Electron alternative developers have been waiting for. Getting started takes one command: `npm create tauri-app@latest`. The documentation is excellent, the Discord community is active, and you can have a cross-platform app running in minutes.
