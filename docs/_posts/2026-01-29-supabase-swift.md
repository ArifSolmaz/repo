Finally, iOS developers get first-class Supabase support without JavaScript bridges or REST workarounds. This official Swift SDK mirrors the beloved supabase-js API exactly, so your backend knowledge transfers seamlessly to mobile. Real-time subscriptions work natively, auth flows feel iOS-native, and database queries compile with Swift's type safety.

What sets this apart is completeness - you get everything from the web SDK: realtime subscriptions, file storage, edge functions, RPC calls, even pgvector queries for AI features. It supports the full Apple ecosystem (iOS, macOS, watchOS, tvOS, visionOS) and installs via SPM with modular packages. The API design is so familiar you'll be productive immediately if you know Supabase already.

With 1,162 stars and official backing, this is how you build modern Swift apps with Supabase. The days of cobbling together REST calls and WebSocket libraries are over - just import Supabase and start building.
